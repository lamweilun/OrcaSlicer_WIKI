# Wipe Tower

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `wipe_tower_type`.  
[Type](option_type#choice): `Choice`.  
[Options](option_type#choice): `type1, type2`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--wipe-tower-type=type1`.  
The prime tower is a structure that is printed before the actual print to ensure that the nozzle is primed with the correct filament. It helps to prevent oozing and stringing during the print. The prime tower can be customized in various ways, such as its size, shape, and position.

## Purge in prime tower

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `purge_in_prime_tower`.  
[Type](option_type#boolean): `Boolean`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--purge-in-prime-tower=1`.  
Purge remaining filament into prime tower.

## Enable filament ramming

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `enable_filament_ramming`.  
[Type](option_type#boolean): `Boolean`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--enable-filament-ramming=1`.  
Enable filament ramming

## Tool Change on Wipe Tower

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `tool_change_on_wipe_tower`.  
[Type](option_type#boolean): `Boolean`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--tool-change-on-wipe-tower=1`.  
Force the toolhead to travel to the wipe tower before issuing the tool change command (Tx).  
Only relevant for multi-extruder (multi-toolhead) printers using a Type 2 wipe tower.  
By default Orca skips the travel on multi-toolhead machines because the firmware handles the head swap, which can result in the Tx command being issued above the printed part.

Enable this option if you want the tool change to always be issued above the wipe tower instead.

## Wait for Temperature on Wipe Tower

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `wait_for_temp_on_wipe_tower`.  
[Type](option_type#boolean): `Boolean`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--wait-for-temp-on-wipe-tower=1`.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> NEW FEATURE: **Wait for temperature on wipe tower**  
> Available in: [Nightly builds](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/releases/tag/nightly-builds) or Releases greater than **2.4.2**.

Only relevant for multi-extruder (multi-toolhead) printers using a Type 2 wipe tower.  
By default, the new tool's temperature wait happens immediately after the tool change command, wherever the toolhead is at that moment, which can leave ooze from the heat-up on top of the printed part.

Enable this option to defer that wait instead: the incoming tool's target temperature is raised ahead of the tool change rather than blocked on, the toolhead travels to the wipe tower, and only once parked beside it, right before purging, does it wait to actually reach temperature. Ooze from the heat-up then lands next to the tower instead of on the model, and the travel overlaps with the heat-up instead of adding to it.

> [!CAUTION]
> Your firmware or tool change macro must not already wait for the temperature itself, or the toolhead will end up waiting twice.
