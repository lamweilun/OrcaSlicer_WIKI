# For creators

Publishing lets you share a repeatable configuration with a model. You choose which settings are included, embed whole filament presets, and require or suggest the materials a design needs.

## Publishing a project

### Opening the dialog

**File → Publish 3MF…**, or `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `Shift` + `E`. (Needs at least one object on the plate.)

Settings that differ from your base presets are pre-checked and bold; the rest start unchecked.

### Choosing what to include

- **Filter box** ("Type to filter...").
- **All** / **None** buttons.
- **Filter menu** (right-click or the menu button): Select/Deselect All, Select/Deselect visible, and Filter selected / Filter non-selected.

If you check nothing, the file carries only the geometry.

### Printer tab

One tab per extruder, each listing that extruder's **Retraction** and **Z-Hop** values.

### Filament tab

One tab per filament slot. A slot publishes nothing until **Enable** is ticked.

An enabled slot offers:

- **Material** requirements (these don't publish values — they constrain what the receiver applies):
    - **Color** — the required filament colour.
    - **Type** — the required material family (e.g. `PLA`).
- **Full Publish** — embed the whole filament preset; disables the per-setting rows.

### Mixed filaments

Enabling a particular mixed filament automatically selects the required filament components.

> [!NOTE]
> If a mixed filament is enabled, but its required components are either disabled or have their type unchecked, a warning message will be shown.
> This does not prevent publishing.

### Process tab

Mirrors the Process settings: one inner tab per page (**Quality**, **Speed**, **Strength**…), each keeping its option grouping.

## Tips

- **Publish only what matters.** Include just the settings that affect how the model prints.
- **Use Full Publish for filaments you tuned hard** — it embeds the whole preset in the file.
- **Name files clearly** — OrcaSlicer suggests `.published.3mf`.
- **Check the tab indicator dots** to see what you've selected before **OK**.

## Things to note

- **A mixed filament needs its components to be published too** — otherwise they can lose their material on the other side.
- **Not every setting survives a round-trip** — mismatches are skipped and reported after load.
- **The receiver's preset library is never modified** — Full Publish presets live only in the loaded project.
- **Single-extruder printers get only the first extruder's values.**
