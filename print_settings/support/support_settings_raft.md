# Raft

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variables](built_in_placeholders_variables): `raft_layers`, `raft_contact_distance`.  
[Type](option_type): `raft_layers` (Integer), `raft_contact_distance` (Float).  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--raft-layers=1` (`raft_layers` shown; other variables above follow their own type).  
Raft is a base layer that is printed under the object to improve adhesion and prevent warping. It consists of multiple layers of material that create a stable foundation for the print.

## Layers

Object will be raised by this number of support layers.

## Contact Z distance

Z gap between object and raft. Ignored for soluble interface.
