## Z distance

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variables](built_in_placeholders_variables): `support_top_z_distance`, `support_bottom_z_distance`.  
[Type](option_type#integer-float-percentage): `Float`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--support-top-z-distance=1` (same pattern for the other variables above).  
The Z gap between support interface and object.

## Support wall loops

[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `tree_support_wall_count`.  
[Type](option_type#integer-float-percentage): `Integer`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--tree-support-wall-count=1`.  
This setting specifies the count of support walls in the range of [0,2]. 0 means auto.

[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `support_base_pattern`.  
[Type](option_type#choice): `Choice`.  
[Options](option_type#choice): `default, rectilinear, rectilinear-grid, honeycomb, lightning, hollow`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--support-base-pattern=default`.  
Line pattern for the base of the support.

### Base pattern spacing

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `support_base_pattern_spacing`.  
[Type](option_type#integer-float-percentage): `Float`.

Spacing between support lines.

## Pattern angle

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `support_angle`.  
[Type](option_type#integer-float-percentage): `Float`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--support-angle=1`.  
Use this setting to rotate the support pattern on the horizontal plane.

## Interface layers

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variables](built_in_placeholders_variables): `support_interface_top_layers`, `support_interface_bottom_layers`.  
[Type](option_type#integer-float-percentage): `Integer`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--support-interface-top-layers=1` (same pattern for the other variables above).  
The number of interface layers.

The number you set is the total thickness of the dense interface, counted in printed layers and including the layer that faces the model. Set `1` and you get a single dense layer; set `3` and you get three. More layers give a flatter, better supported surface but take longer to print and are harder to peel off.

The top and bottom interfaces are set separately:

- **Top interface layers** (`support_interface_top_layers`) are the layers printed under an overhang, below the [Z distance](#z-distance) gap. These are the ones that determine the finish of the supported surface.
- **Bottom interface layers** (`support_interface_bottom_layers`) are the layers printed where a support lands on top of the model, protecting that surface from the support body. `Same as top` reuses the top value. You can use bottom interfaces on their own, with top interface layers set to `0`.

With both set to `0` there is no interface at all: the support prints all the way through with the [Base Pattern](#base-pattern), which is fastest and easiest to remove but leaves the roughest overhangs.

> [!TIP]
> When the interface has its own filament assigned, this number also decides how the layers are shared between the two materials. See [Interface filament transitions](support_settings_filament#interface-filament-transitions).

## Interface pattern

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `support_interface_pattern`.  
[Type](option_type#choice): `Choice`.  
[Options](option_type#choice): `auto, rectilinear, concentric, spiralinset, rectilinear_interlaced, grid`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--support-interface-pattern=auto`.  
The pattern used for the support interface.

Each option lays the interface lines out differently, and all of them are measured from [Pattern angle](#pattern-angle), so rotating that rotates the interface with it. The same rules apply to normal and tree supports.

| Option | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| `Default` | Straight lines crossing the support at 90° to Pattern angle. Switches to concentric loops when the interface touches the model, which is the usual case for soluble supports. |
| `Rectilinear` | Straight lines at 90° to Pattern angle. With the [Snug](support_settings_support#snug) style they are rotated a further 45°. |
| `Concentric` | Loops following the outline of the interface, which peel off in one piece and leave no line ends on the surface. |
| `Rectilinear Interlaced` | Straight lines that swing 45° one way then the other on each successive layer, so the layers cross instead of stacking. This ties the interface together and makes it stiffer under the overhang. |
| `Grid` | Straight lines running along Pattern angle, in line with the [Base Pattern](#base-pattern) below. |

If [Interface spacing](#interface-spacing) is wide enough that the interface is no longer solid, the straight-line options switch to the base support pattern so that the sparse lines still anchor to each other.

## Interface spacing

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variables](built_in_placeholders_variables): `support_interface_spacing`, `support_bottom_interface_spacing`.  
[Type](option_type#integer-float-percentage): `Float`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--support-interface-spacing=1` (same pattern for the other variables above).  
Spacing of interface lines. Zero means solid interface.

The top (`support_interface_spacing`) and bottom (`support_bottom_interface_spacing`) values are set separately and neither one affects the other, so a bottom interface keeps the spacing you gave it even if you have turned top interfaces off.

## Normal support expansion

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `support_expansion`.  
[Type](option_type#integer-float-percentage): `Float`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--support-expansion=1`.  
Expand (+) or shrink (-) the horizontal span of normal support.

## Support/object XY distance

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `support_object_xy_distance`.  
[Type](option_type#integer-float-percentage): `Float`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--support-object-xy-distance=1`.  
XY separation between an object and its support.

## Support/object first layer gap

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `support_object_first_layer_gap`.  
[Type](option_type#integer-float-percentage): `Float`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--support-object-first-layer-gap=1`.  
XY separation between an object and its support at the first layer.

## Don't support bridges

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `bridge_no_support`.  
[Type](option_type#boolean): `Boolean`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--bridge-no-support=1`.  
Don't support the whole bridge area which make support very large. Bridges can usually be printed directly without support if not very long.

## Independent support layer height

[Mode](option_mode): `Advanced`.  
[Variable](built_in_placeholders_variables): `independent_support_layer_height`.  
[Type](option_type#boolean): `Boolean`.  
[CLI Example](cli_mode#setting-overrides): `--independent-support-layer-height=1`.  
Support layer uses layer height independent with object layer. This is to support customizing z-gap and save print time. This option will be invalid when the prime tower is enabled.

Turning this on changes the height of the support layers, not their number: you still get exactly the [Interface layers](#interface-layers) you asked for, including with the `Tree Slim`, `Tree Strong` and `Tree Hybrid` styles.
