# Build on Windows

Building OrcaSlicer for 64-bit Windows. `build_win.bat` installs the prerequisites and builds both the dependencies and the slicer. MSVC is the default toolchain, and clang-cl (LLVM) is supported as an alternative.

## Tools Required

> [!TIP]
> Once the repository is cloned, `build_win.bat --install-vs ide` installs all of these. See [The Build Script](#the-build-script).

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) 2026, 2022, or 2019 16.8 or newer, with the *Desktop development with C++* workload

    ```pwsh
    winget install --id=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Community -e --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --includeRecommended --passive --wait"
    ```

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

    ```pwsh
    winget install --id=Kitware.CMake -e
    ```

- [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/)

    ```pwsh
    winget install --id=StrawberryPerl.StrawberryPerl -e
    ```

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

    ```pwsh
    winget install --id=Git.Git -e
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A plain `winget install` of Visual Studio installs the IDE without any C++ compiler, and the build fails later with CMake unable to find a Visual Studio instance. The `--override` flags above add the required *Desktop development with C++* workload.
>
> If Visual Studio is already installed without it, add the workload from **Visual Studio Installer** -> **Modify** -> check *Desktop development with C++* -> **Modify**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Strawberry Perl bundles its own CMake. If it comes first on `PATH`, `cmake --version` reports that copy rather than the one you installed. Run `where cmake` to list the active copies, then reorder **System Environment Variables** > **Path** so the real one wins:
>
> ```text
> C:\Program Files\CMake\bin
> C:\Strawberry\c\bin
> ```
>
> OrcaSlicer needs CMake 3.13 or newer, and 3.21 or newer for the clang-cl presets below. CMake 4.x is fine. `build_win.bat` skips Strawberry's copy for its own runs, so this only affects CMake invoked directly.

## Hardware Requirements

- Minimum 16 GB RAM
- Minimum 23 GB free disk space
- 64-bit CPU
- 64-bit Windows 10 or later

## Get the Source

Clone the repository, either from GitHub Desktop or on the command line:

```pwsh
git clone https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer
```

Nothing below needs a developer command prompt. Change into the clone:

```pwsh
cd path\to\OrcaSlicer
```

## The Build Script

`build_win.bat` in the repository root builds the dependencies and the slicer. It runs from any shell and any directory, and sets up the Visual Studio environment itself.

It installs the tools listed above, Visual Studio included, with the components a build actually needs:

```pwsh
build_win.bat --install-vs ide
```

Use `buildtools` in place of `ide` for the Build Tools without the IDE, and add `-l` to include the clang toolset. Restart the shell afterwards so the new `PATH` applies. `build_win.bat -u` installs only CMake, Perl and Git.

`build_win.bat --help` lists every option. The ones that come up most:

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `-d`, `-s` | Build the dependencies, build the slicer. `-ds` does both. |
| `--config <name>` | `release` (default), `debug`, `relwithdebinfo` or `minsizerel` |
| `-l`, `-x` | Compile with clang-cl, generate with Ninja Multi-Config |
| `--tests` | Build the unit tests alongside the slicer |
| `--run-tests` | Build them and run them |
| `--slicer-target <name>` | Build one target instead of everything |
| `--no-configure` | Skip the configure step when only sources changed |
| `--no-gettext` | Skip regenerating the translations |
| `-j <n>` | Cap the number of parallel compilers |
| `-c` | Delete the directories this run would build |
| `--cache <tool>` | Compile through [a compiler cache](compiler_caching), needs `-l -x` |
| `-D` | Print every command instead of running it |

Build directories are named for the configuration, compiler and architecture that made them, so changing any of the three configures a new directory instead of reusing one built another way:

| Build | Slicer directory | Dependency directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MSVC, Release | `build\` | `deps\build\` |
| MSVC, Debug | `build-dbg\` | `deps\build-dbg\` |
| MSVC, RelWithDebInfo | `build-dbginfo\` | `deps\build\` |
| clang-cl, Release | `build-clang\` | `deps\build-clang\` |

`--arch arm64` adds `-arm64` to both names. `--build-dir` and `--deps-dir` override either one, so a build can share dependencies with another checkout. Every run ends with a block naming what it produced and the commands to carry on with.

## Build the Dependencies

Every slicer build links a matching set of dependencies, and each set is built once. Start with the release set:

```pwsh
build_win.bat -d
```

This one installs into `deps\build\OrcaSlicer_dep\usr\local`.

Debug builds link the debug C runtime (`/MDd`), which cannot be mixed with the release one, so they need a separate set:

```pwsh
build_win.bat -d --config debug
```

Those install into `deps\build-dbg\` and are required for a Debug build under either toolchain. Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel all link the release set.

> [!TIP]
> clang-cl targets the MSVC ABI, so it links against the MSVC dependencies. `-d -l -x` builds a second copy in `deps\build-clang\`. Point `--deps-dir` at an existing MSVC one to skip that build:
>
> ```pwsh
> build_win.bat -s -l -x --deps-dir C:\path\to\OrcaSlicer\deps\build
> ```

## Building with MSVC

MSVC with the Visual Studio generator is the default, and the toolchain CI uses.

1. Build OrcaSlicer:

    ```pwsh
    build_win.bat -s
    ```

2. Open the generated solution. The block at the end of the build names it:

    ```text
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    Build completed in 0h 33m 4s
      OrcaSlicer    C:\src\OrcaSlicer\build\src\Release\orca-slicer.exe
      Solution      C:\src\OrcaSlicer\build\OrcaSlicer.slnx

    Next
        Run it                build\src\Release\orca-slicer.exe
        Open in Visual Studio build\OrcaSlicer.slnx
        Rebuild after edits   build_win.bat -s --no-configure
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

    Visual Studio 2026 writes `OrcaSlicer.slnx` and the releases before it `OrcaSlicer.sln`.

3. Set the build configuration to `Release` and run the **Local Windows Debugger**.

    ![compile_vs_local_debugger](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer_WIKI/blob/main/images/develop/compile_vs_local_debugger.png?raw=true)

4. The executable is written to:

    ```pwsh
    build\src\Release\orca-slicer.exe
    ```

For a Debug build, build the debug dependencies first, then:

```pwsh
build_win.bat -s --config debug
```

That writes `build-dbg\src\Debug\orca-slicer.exe` and finds `deps\build-dbg` on its own, because both directories are named for the configuration.

`build_win.bat -s --run-tests` builds the test suites and runs them. See [How to Test](how_to_test) for more.

> [!NOTE]
> The first build of any branch is slow. After that, changes to `.cpp` files compile quickly and changes to `.hpp` files take longer depending on how widely the header is included. Switching branches back and forth also forces a long rebuild even when nothing else changed.

## Building with clang-cl

OrcaSlicer also builds with the **clang-cl (LLVM)** toolchain and the **Ninja** generator. It compiles the project considerably faster than MSVC on the same machine, which is the main reason to use it. Official builds and CI use MSVC, so a change still has to compile there.

`build_win.bat -l -x` needs nothing beyond the tools below; see [Command Line](#command-line). The preset file after it is for building and debugging inside Visual Studio or VS Code.

### Additional Tools

clang-cl needs the clang toolset on top of the *Desktop development with C++* workload. `build_win.bat` installs it:

```pwsh
build_win.bat --install-vs ide -l
```

That adds the **C++ Clang Compiler for Windows** component, which puts `clang-cl.exe` and `lld-link.exe` under `VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin`. To add it by hand instead, go to **Visual Studio Installer** -> **Modify** -> **Individual components** and search for *Clang*.

Ninja comes with Visual Studio, and `build_win.bat` finds that copy. VS Code and a bare `cmake --preset` run need their own on `PATH`:

```pwsh
winget install --id=Ninja-build.Ninja -e
```

> [!NOTE]
> The separate **MSBuild support for LLVM (clang-cl) toolset** component (`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Llvm.ClangToolset`) drives clang-cl through the Visual Studio generator, as `build_win.bat -l` without `-x` does. The Ninja setup below does not use it.

### The Preset File

Visual Studio, VS Code and `cmake --preset` all read the same CMake preset file. Create `CMakeUserPresets.json` in the repository root:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "configurePresets": [
    {

        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "buildPresets": [

    { "name": "x64-clang-debug-build",    "configurePreset": "x64-clang-debug", "configuration": "Debug" }
  ],
  "testPresets": [
    {
      "name": "x64-clang-test-release",
      "configurePreset": "x64-clang",
      "configuration": "Release",
      "output": { "outputOnFailure": true }
    },
    {
      "name": "x64-clang-test-relwithdebinfo",
      "configurePreset": "x64-clang",
      "configuration": "RelWithDebInfo",
      "output": { "outputOnFailure": true }
    },
    {
      "name": "x64-clang-test-debug",
      "configurePreset": "x64-clang-debug",
      "configuration": "Debug",
      "output": { "outputOnFailure": true }
    }
  ]
}
```

`x64-clang` uses Ninja Multi-Config, so one build directory holds Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel. Switching between them needs no reconfigure. `x64-clang-debug` is separate because it links the Debug dependencies.

Neither preset sets `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`. CMake derives the dependency directory from the **name** of the build directory, so `build-clang` finds `deps\build-clang` and `build-dbg-clang` finds `deps\build-dbg-clang`. Those are the names `build_win.bat -l -x` uses, so the presets and the script share build directories and neither reconfigures what the other built.

All four configurations carry symbols, since `SLIC3R_MSVC_PDB` adds `/Zi` to every MSVC build by default. Optimization is what makes Release and MinSizeRel awkward to step through, with inlined frames and variables the debugger cannot show, so switch to RelWithDebInfo when you need to debug.

> [!TIP]
> `BUILD_TESTS` is `ON` so the test suites build alongside the application, and the test presets can run them. Set it to `OFF` for slightly faster builds if you do not need them. See [How to Test](how_to_test).

> [!TIP]
> Four more entries in `cacheVariables` build these presets through a compiler cache, so the IDE and `build_win.bat` reuse each other's work. See [Compiler Caching](compiler_caching).

> [!TIP]
> On Ninja 1.12 or newer, changing `NINJA_STATUS` to `"[%f/%t %p :: %w / %W] "` adds elapsed time and an ETA to each line:
>
> ```text
> [119/760  15% :: 00:07 / 07:23] Building CXX object src\libslic3r\CMakeFiles\libslic3r.dir\RelWithDebInfo\Fill\FillBase.cpp.obj
> ```

### Visual Studio

1. Open the repository as a CMake project: **File > Open > Folder**. Do not open `build\OrcaSlicer.slnx`, which is the MSVC solution.
2. Pick a build preset in the **Configuration** dropdown, `x64-clang-release` for instance. Visual Studio labels that dropdown *Configuration*, but its entries are build presets, and each one names a configure preset and a configuration together, so it is the only thing to set.
3. Set the startup item to the `orca-slicer.exe` entry whose path matches that preset, `src\Release\orca-slicer.exe` for `x64-clang-release`. Visual Studio defaults to a different executable and remembers your choice from then on. Do not pick either `(Install)` entry.
4. Build with **Build > Build All**. The executable is written under the preset's build directory, so `x64-clang-release` gives:

    ```pwsh
    build-clang\src\Release\orca-slicer.exe
    ```

5. Run the tests with **Test > Run CTests for OrcaSlicer** once they are built.

> [!NOTE]
> `x64-clang-debug-build` uses a single-configuration generator, so it has no per-configuration subdirectory. Its startup item is `src\orca-slicer.exe` and the executable lands in `build-dbg-clang\src\orca-slicer.exe`.

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio may show a *Build failed* prompt on the first build even though the build succeeded and the application runs. Choosing to continue starts it normally, and later builds do not prompt. Check the **Output** pane instead of the dialog. A real failure names a file, and a failed configure step produces the same dialog.

### VS Code

Requires the **CMake Tools** extension (`ms-vscode.cmake-tools`). It switches to preset mode on its own once `CMakeUserPresets.json` exists, so there is nothing to configure.

Open the **CMake** panel from the Activity Bar and set the entries under **Project Status**:

- **Configure** to `x64 Clang`
- **Build** to the configuration you want, `x64-clang-release` for instance
- **Test** to `x64-clang-test-release`
- **Launch** and **Debug** to `OrcaSlicer_app_gui`, both of which default to `all`. Pick the entry under `src\Release\`, not `OrcaSlicer_app_gui (Install)`

The build preset carries the configuration, so switching between Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel means switching build preset. The same entries are on the Command Palette under **CMake: Select Configure Preset** and **CMake: Select Build Preset**.

The **Launch** and **Debug** entries in that panel run the selected target directly. To debug with `F5` instead, add a launch configuration to `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "OrcaSlicer",
      "type": "cppvsdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}",
      "args": [],
      "cwd": "${command:cmake.launchTargetDirectory}",
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "console": "internalConsole"
    }
  ]
}
```

`cppvsdbg` is the Windows debugger and reads the PDBs clang-cl produces. The `${command:cmake...}` values follow the active launch target and build preset, so nothing is hard-coded. `cwd` starts the application next to the `resources` junction it needs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Without that configuration, **Run > Start Debugging** offers to generate one and suggests **C++ (GDB/LLDB)**, which targets MinGW and LLDB. The template it writes debugs a single source file and fails with *Variable ${fileDirname} can not be resolved*.

### Command Line

`build_win.bat -l -x` builds with clang-cl and Ninja without a preset file, from any shell and with no developer command prompt:

```pwsh
build_win.bat -d -l -x
build_win.bat -s -l -x
```

That builds `deps\build-clang\` and `build-clang\`, and writes:

```pwsh
build-clang\src\Release\orca-slicer.exe
```

To build through the presets instead, from the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS**, which puts `clang-cl`, `lld-link` and the Windows SDK on `PATH`:

```pwsh
cmake --preset x64-clang
cmake --build --preset x64-clang-release
ctest --preset x64-clang-test-release
```

The executable is written to:

```pwsh
build-clang\src\Release\orca-slicer.exe
```

## Troubleshooting

### Dependencies

> [!TIP]
> Some changes are not picked up by a rebuild because they live in the prebuilt dependencies, not in the OrcaSlicer sources. Rebuild the affected dependency on its own instead of everything under `deps/`.
>
> For example, after modifying `wxInspector`:
>
> ```pwsh
> build_win.bat -d -t dep_wxInspector
> ```
>
> The dependency set follows your toolchain flags, so add `-l -x` to rebuild the one in `deps\build-clang`. Then rebuild the slicer so the updated dependency is linked in.

> [!TIP]
> A dependency build that fails with `patch does not apply` is being patched twice, and `git apply` cannot apply a patch to sources that already carry it. Rebuild that set from scratch:
>
> ```pwsh
> build_win.bat -d -c
> ```
>
> `-c` removes the directory this run would build, so it clears the one matching your `--config` and toolchain flags.

> [!TIP]
> A failed run ends by naming the command that broke and suggesting a `-c` retry scoped to the stage that failed. To discard both the dependencies and the slicer and start over:
>
> ```pwsh
> build_win.bat -ds -c
> ```

> [!TIP]
> If the build fails while configuring ZLIB, uninstall ZLIB from your Vcpkg library.

### Windows SDK

> [!TIP]
> If the *Fix model* option is missing from an object's context menu, the build did not pick up the Windows SDK. To fix it:
>
> 1. Locate the `winrt` folder in your Windows SDK installation, for example:
>
>    ```pwsh
>    C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.26100.0\winrt
>    ```
>
>    The exact path varies with your Windows SDK version.
>
> 2. Open the **libslic3r_gui** project properties and go to **Configuration Properties > C/C++ > Preprocessor > Preprocessor Definitions**. Add `HAS_WIN10SDK`.
>
> 3. Open the **OrcaSlicer_app_gui** project properties and go to **Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories**. Add the path to the `winrt` folder from step 1.
>
> 4. Build the solution.

### clang-cl

> [!TIP]
> When a clang-cl build misbehaves, check which compiler it used. `build_win.bat` prints that before the build starts:
>
> ```text
> Compiler: C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Community/VC/Tools/Llvm/x64/bin/clang-cl.exe
> ```
>
> That is the one from Visual Studio unless `--clang-path` says otherwise, so a standalone LLVM cannot be picked up by accident.
>
> The presets are a different case. They resolve a bare `clang-cl` through `PATH`, and the developer command prompt appends the Visual Studio LLVM directory to the *end* of `PATH`, so an installation like `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin` wins. An old one fails the compiler check before anything is compiled:
>
> ```text
> -- The C compiler identification is Clang 11.0.0 with MSVC-like command-line
> -- Check for working C compiler: C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang-cl.exe - broken
> lld-link: error: undefined symbol: __guard_eh_cont_table
> ```
>
> Run `where clang-cl` to list the active copies. Then either put the Visual Studio directory first in **System Environment Variables** > **Path**, or replace the bare `clang-cl` in the preset's `environment` block with a full path.

> [!TIP]
> Dependencies built by an older checkout fail under clang-cl in two ways.
>
> **TBB** was compiled with `/GL`, and `lld-link` rejects LTCG objects. This surfaces late, at the `Linking CXX shared library src\OrcaSlicer.dll` step, as one error per object with no file or line:
>
> ```text
> lld-link: error: tbb.dir\Release\queuing_rw_mutex.obj: is not a native COFF file. Recompile without /GL?
> ```
>
> **wxWidgets** installs its libraries under `vc_x64_lib`, but its own CMake config file looks for a `clang_x64_lib` directory when the compiler is clang-cl. This fails at configure time, with an `include could not find requested file` error naming `clang_x64_lib/wxWidgetsTargets.cmake`.
>
> Rebuilding the clang dependencies from scratch fixes both:
>
> ```pwsh
> build_win.bat -d -l -x -c
> ```
>
> To rebuild only TBB, delete `deps\build-clang\dep_TBB-prefix` first so its stamp files go with it, then name the one target:
>
> ```pwsh
> build_win.bat -d -l -x -t dep_TBB
> ```
