# Compiler Caching

A compiler cache keeps the object file each compile produced, stored against a hash of the source, the headers it pulled in and the command line. When those inputs come round again the object is copied back instead of compiled. Rebuilding after a branch switch, a reconfigure, or into a new build directory then costs a fraction of the usual time.

OrcaSlicer supports [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) and [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) on Windows and Linux.

## What It Costs

Caching is not free, and whether it pays depends on how you work.

A cache only helps when it is asked for something it already holds, so the first build of anything fills it and gains nothing. Both tools also refuse to cache a compile that uses a precompiled header, so enabling a cache means building without one. That makes every compile parse the full header set itself, which roughly doubles a build from scratch.

What you get back is the rebuild. A configuration already in the cache links rather than compiles, so the same work drops from tens of minutes to around a minute, most of which is linking.

That trade suits some habits more than others:

- **Worth it** if you switch branches often, keep more than one build directory, reconfigure regularly, or rebuild the same commit in a different configuration.
- **Not worth much** if you build one directory, edit a handful of files and rebuild incrementally. Ninja already skips everything you did not touch, and the precompiled header makes the files you did touch compile faster.

## Windows

ccache already ships inside [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/), which the build needs anyway, so `where ccache` usually finds one. If not:

```pwsh
winget install --id=Ccache.Ccache -e
```

Then pass `--cache` to [the build script](how_to_build_windows#the-build-script):

```pwsh
build_win.bat -s -l -x --cache ccache
```

The value is `ccache`, `sccache` or `off`. It needs `-l -x`, because CMake only runs a compiler launcher under the Ninja and Makefile generators, and ccache refuses a `cl.exe` compile that carries `/Zi`.

`--cache` also turns the precompiled header off, since neither tool caches a compile that uses one.

The build script names the tool it resolved before it starts:

```text
Precompiled header: off
Compiler cache: C:/Strawberry/c/bin/ccache.exe
```

### Visual Studio and VS Code

Neither reads the build script, so the same settings need added to [the preset file](how_to_build_windows#the-preset-file). Four entries in `cacheVariables`:

```json
"CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER": "ccache",
"CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER": "ccache",
"SLIC3R_PCH": { "type": "BOOL", "value": "OFF" },
"SLIC3R_RELATIVE_DEBUG_PATHS": { "type": "BOOL", "value": "ON" }
```

ccache has to be on `PATH` for the IDE process. Because those presets already build into the same directories `build_win.bat` uses, the IDE and the script then reuse each other's work instead of reconfiguring over it.

## Linux

Install ccache from the package manager, for example `apt install ccache` or `pacman -S ccache`.

[`build_linux.sh`](how_to_build_linux) enables caching by itself once a tool is on `PATH`, preferring sccache over ccache. Name the one you want with `CMAKE_CCACHE`:

```bash
CMAKE_CCACHE=ccache ./build_linux.sh -s
```

Add `-p` to disable the precompiled header, which the script's own help describes as boosting the ccache hit rate. On Windows `--cache` does this for you; on Linux it stays a separate choice, so a cache without `-p` will refuse most of what it is offered.

## macOS

Not supported. `build_release_macos.sh` has no compiler launcher option, and nothing in the macOS build sets one, so there is nothing to enable.

## Cache Size

Once the cache is full, both tools evict whatever was used least recently, so too small a limit discards builds you still want. ccache defaults to 5 GB and one full build of OrcaSlicer occupies 1 to 2 GB of it, so raise the limit by roughly how many builds you want kept:

```pwsh
ccache -M 20G
```

A build here means one configuration of one checkout. Debug and Release count separately, as does the same commit in a second worktree.

- **5 GB**, the default, keeps two or three. Enough while you stay in one configuration.
- **20 GB** covers several configurations and branches, which suits most work.
- **50 GB** or more if you keep multiple worktrees, or move between Debug and Release regularly.

## Sharing One Cache Between Build Directories

This part is ccache only; sccache has no equivalent setting.

By default an object records the directory it was compiled in, so a second build directory shares nothing with the first even at the same commit. Two ccache settings and one build option change that.

`ccache --show-config` prints which file it reads. Add:

```text
base_dir = /path/that/contains/your/checkouts
hash_dir = false
```

`base_dir` has to be an ancestor of the sources, the build directories **and** the dependency prefix. If it covers only some of them, ccache rewrites part of each compile line and the rest still differs.

The build option is `SLIC3R_RELATIVE_DEBUG_PATHS`, which records `.` as the compilation directory rather than an absolute path. `--cache` sets it, and the preset entries above set it explicitly. Debugging is unaffected, because the linker writes the absolute source paths into the PDB.

> [!NOTE]
> Turning this on changes every compile line, so the first build afterwards rebuilds everything and fills the cache again.

## Checking It Works

```pwsh
ccache -s
```

`Cacheable calls` is how many compiles ccache saw and `Hits` how many it served without compiling. A first build is mostly misses. Build the same commit into a fresh directory and those files should come back as hits, nearly all of them direct.

`Uncacheable calls` in the hundreds means something is stopping ccache from storing most of what it sees. `ccache -sv` names the reason for each one. A precompiled header still being used is the common cause, and `/Zi` on a `cl.exe` compile is the other.
